This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Informal School of IT - Final Project: My-React-Portfolio
This is a simple single-page application build with React.js. 

The routes are implemented via React-Router, styling is done using defined classes from React-Bootstrap and the contact form is validated by Formspree.io, a forms-as-a-service provider.

Each page has a navigation in the header section, a page content section and a footer section.
